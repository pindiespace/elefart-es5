TODO LIST:

1. Define objects in a hierarchy using prototype or prototype-like methods

   -Shape->ScreenObject->instance

2. Define getters in a more rational way

3. Constrain all positions and sizes to integer values

4. Expand drawing so some objects are rendered, and the resulting image is 
   scrolled. This also requires a bettery method for generating layers.

5. Define layers, and canvas in a better way
   -layers are within a canvas
   -ability to assemble some layers as scrolling image, some as dynamic redraws
