Blackout
========
_by [Tyler Fink](http://www.sursly.com)_

Eats holes for breakfast lunch and dinner. Inspired by filling in sans-serif newspaper headlines. Continually updated with coffee and music. Makes your work louder than the next personâ€™s.

Comes in two styles: Midnight (solid) & 2AM (reversed).

    Notes from Tyler:
    
    I made this font in 2008 with Illustrator and Font Lab Studio, 
    both of which are wonderful. This is not based on any other 
    font and was created from scratch, although I'm sure there are 
    similarities to other fonts out there (purely coincidental). 
    
    It was created for my own personal portfolio (I tend to do that) 
    because I didn't want to simply fill in the holes of some favorite 
    bold fonts. "Midnight" came first, but then I realized that I was 
    tired of reversing the font color and adding a background to that 
    font, so "2 AM" was born.
    
    These fonts are not perfect. They are missing symbols and 
    characters. But they are usable, and in my opinion, very fun. 
    When using "2 AM" insert an underscore "_" to maintain a solid
    background.
